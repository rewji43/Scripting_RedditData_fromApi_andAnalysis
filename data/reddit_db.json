Just look at the US sales of any group before and after they distributed in offline stores.\n\nKTL sold roughly less than 10k in the US... that number doesn’t even come close to the amount of fans they have and tickets they sold at the sold out US tour. They clearly have so many American fans but the lack of physical distribution in offline stores is holding them back a lot. \n\nI’m really in the dark as to what UMG has even been doing for Blackpink but to be fair they’re probably being restricted by YGE because it seems like something YGE would do lol."}

Plus C-blinks and international blinks are raising money to mass buy Blackpinks album in order to increase sales. Thus its a good source of income for YG, though YGs biggest revenue comes from touring. \n\nYG is known for being digital monsters. So because they’re more likely to be digitally strong and do well. It makes sense for YG to focus on physical sales especially with huge fan base. Like being able to distribute at international stores like Target and blackpink are very strong in SEA so it makes sense to target their for physical sales in SEA . Or putting more time and emphasis on the physical album.???\n\nIdk ??"}

The reasoning being that the concert will be broadcasted in theatres across Japan as well as YG’s refusal to cancel the concert despite coronavirus concerns.\n\nIf we are getting a CB announcement at the concert, then it kinda makes sense why it will still be going on. YG (a week ago) did say that information about the comeback will be coming soon, and if he cancelled this concert then schedules and plans (should the CB be announced here) would be put into disarray. \n\nDo you guys think this is likely? Or typical clown shit?"}

Blackpink’s US sales could be so much better if people could actually buy from their local store as it would have a bigger impact on the Billboard charts instead of having to buy online and pay for shipping and all this extra stuff. More people would buy as it would be so much easier. Just look at the US sales of any group before and after they distributed in offline stores.\n\nKTL sold roughly less than 10k in the US... that number doesn’t even come close to the amount of fans they have and tickets they sold at the sold out US tour. They clearly have so many American fans but the lack of physical distribution in offline stores is holding them back a lot. \n\nI’m really in the dark as to what UMG has even been doing for Blackpink but to be fair they’re probably being restricted by YGE because it seems like something YGE would do lol."}

Plus C-blinks and international blinks are raising money to mass buy Blackpinks album in order to increase sales. Thus its a good source of income for YG, though YGs biggest revenue comes from touring. \n\nYG is known for being digital monsters. So because they’re more likely to be digitally strong and do well. It makes sense for YG to focus on physical sales especially with huge fan base. Like being able to distribute at international stores like Target and blackpink are very strong in SEA so it makes sense to target their for physical sales in SEA . Or putting more time and emphasis on the physical album.???\n\nIdk ??"}

The reasoning being that the concert will be broadcasted in theatres across Japan as well as YG’s refusal to cancel the concert despite coronavirus concerns.\n\nIf we are getting a CB announcement at the concert, then it kinda makes sense why it will still be going on. YG (a week ago) did say that information about the comeback will be coming soon, and if he cancelled this concert then schedules and plans (should the CB be announced here) would be put into disarray. \n\nDo you guys think this is likely? Or typical clown shit?"}

Blackpink’s US sales could be so much better if people could actually buy from their local store as it would have a bigger impact on the Billboard charts instead of having to buy online and pay for shipping and all this extra stuff. More people would buy as it would be so much easier. Just look at the US sales of any group before and after they distributed in offline stores.\n\nKTL sold roughly less than 10k in the US... that number doesn’t even come close to the amount of fans they have and tickets they sold at the sold out US tour. They clearly have so many American fans but the lack of physical distribution in offline stores is holding them back a lot. \n\nI’m really in the dark as to what UMG has even been doing for Blackpink but to be fair they’re probably being restricted by YGE because it seems like something YGE would do lol."}

Plus C-blinks and international blinks are raising money to mass buy Blackpinks album in order to increase sales. Thus its a good source of income for YG, though YGs biggest revenue comes from touring. \n\nYG is known for being digital monsters. So because they’re more likely to be digitally strong and do well. It makes sense for YG to focus on physical sales especially with huge fan base. Like being able to distribute at international stores like Target and blackpink are very strong in SEA so it makes sense to target their for physical sales in SEA . Or putting more time and emphasis on the physical album.???\n\nIdk ??"}

The reasoning being that the concert will be broadcasted in theatres across Japan as well as YG’s refusal to cancel the concert despite coronavirus concerns.\n\nIf we are getting a CB announcement at the concert, then it kinda makes sense why it will still be going on. YG (a week ago) did say that information about the comeback will be coming soon, and if he cancelled this concert then schedules and plans (should the CB be announced here) would be put into disarray. \n\nDo you guys think this is likely? Or typical clown shit?"}

None of that akgae stuff or comments about someone getting better styling. This is just about personal preference of aesthetic and photo shoot concepts. \n\nFor me it’s Rose. Even though she’s only had one solo photo shoot, the DAZED one was just so much of what I love. The clothes were so gorgeous, the concept was great and her poses were so interesting. I think she has a loot of potential and I hope she works with YSL a lot more. \n\nA close second is jennie. She’s done a lot of photo shoots so her concepts and fashion style is super diverse. I enjoy lisa and jisoo’s solo photo shoots but a lot of them aren’t my personal style.\n\nThe group vogue ones were so gorgeous. I’ve honestly never seen a kpop girl group have such stunning pictorials like that. I can’t wait for comeback teasers and I just hope they’re as amazing!!"}

In the last episode of BP diaries they heavily implied that there will be another season (AKA another world tour) and many sources have also said that BP will have another world tour. I don’t understand why they’d be so secretive and refuse to speak about a world tour that 99% of the fandom knows will happen. \n\nSo what does that leave? Bear in mind that there was a heavy emphasis on the word ‘global.’ \n\nWorldwide fanmeets?\n\nMaybe collab with an international artist? \n\n\n**Or maybe it could be something that reaches international fans:** \n\nSomething like a Netflix series about the girls, a much more deeper and detailed version of BLACKPINK house?\n\nMaybe a movie or documentary?\n\n\nAnother interesting thing to note is that the articles never mentioned an EP or mini album. Whenever DDU or KTL were discussed before they were released, YG always established that they were mini albums. All these articles about BP’s next comeback and there has been no mention of a mini album anywhere."}

They started the countdown for Kill this Love exactly 37 days before release. They started the countdown yesterday which means that should this pattern follow, the next comeback will be on March the 13th.\n\n- Jennie and Jisoo have both mentioned that this next comeback will be different to anything they’ve released before. I think YG are smart enough to not give us another hard hitting black concept for the third time in a row, but a softer pink concept: perfect timing for White Day.\n\n- Releasing a song that lines up with a holiday (and a romantic one at that) is extremely smart as people will associate that event with said song: lots of promotion, becomes a national hit, etc etc.\n\n- The practice room photos: they’ve been working on *something.*\n\n- It would mean a Friday release, which big groups usually target for maximum reach and would still line up with the “early 2020” promise that YG made while still avoiding overlap with other YG artists such as iKON and Sechskies."}

Seems like half the fandom want a pink concept and the other half want another hard hitting black concept. \n\nWe have very little to go on regarding what the comeback will be like. The closest thing we have to information about it is from Jennie and Jisoo:\n\n“It’s different to anything we’ve released so far.”\n“Since Blinks are always so supportive of our music, we don’t have any fear when it comes to exploring new concepts.” (paraphrasing here but that was the general gist of what they said)\n\nClown mask on, but do you think this suggests that they’ve already finished the title track? What concept are you hoping for?\n\n\n\n**ALBUM SALES**\n\nKill this Love showed a very impressive growth in album sales for the girls. \n\nSquare Up ended 2018 with 220k album sales when it came out. Kill this Love ended 2019 with 330k album sales. That’s a massive 110k growth in just one comeback. With this rate of growth, it would be logical to conclude that the next comeback will hit the 400k mark before the year ends. \n\nI believe this figure could be higher, should we be given a full album. I’m also interested in the preorder stats and first day sales. For those that don’t know, Kill this Love wasn’t available for preorder. Just recently LOONA clocked an estimated 100k preorders for their comeback, which makes me very interested in what BP will get. As for first day sales, BP has the most for a girl group with 78k. A large factor to this figure was the Chinese fanbase. Given the fact the number of C-Blinks have practically doubled in size since KTL, I think we could comfortably hit 100k first day sales.\n\n\n**CHARTING AND DOMESTIC RECEPTION**\n\nI’m not too worried about charting. A lot of fans have this perception that KTL flopped on the charts, when in reality it went first everywhere except Melon  (where it was second) where it was blocked by a digital monster in BOL4. KTL, despite its “lukewarm” reception to Koreans was still the second most downloaded GG song on Gaon (to Dalla Dalla) and also had the second highest average daily ranking for GG songs (also second to Dalla Dalla). But antis will leave that part out when they try to drag...\n\nSorry for the text dump, but we don’t really see much discussion around here and I thought it would be interesting."}

The truth of the matter is that 2019 has been their biggest year and they are doing better than ever. \n\nLet's see how 2019 went for them - \n\n1. Kill this Love sold VERY well. Had the biggest female debut ever, outsold Square Up and doubled their sales in Japan and China. \n\n2. Had the biggest female kpop tour of ALL TIME. \n\n3. *Doubled* their total streams on Spotify, most streamed and followed girl group worldwide (more than double that of Twice) and had 4 out of 5 most streamed Kpop songs in 2019.\n\n4. *Doubled* their YouTube subscribers from 2018 and have probably the biggest YouTube presence of any artist worldwide, let alone Kpop. \n\n5. By far the biggest Social Media presence in all of Kpop, complete dominance. All 4 girls became the top 4 most followed Kpop artists on Instagram in almost just an year."}

And I’ll explain why I feel this way.\n\n1. They retweeted lots of gifs of JENNIE in the Samsung Indonesia fan meeting, claimed that there were so many toxic comments toward her, so she was sad and almost broke down.\n\n[Example 1](https://twitter.com/106ny/status/1217336160281739264?s=21)\n\nThe fact is, [they’re taking selfie at that time, not reading comments.](https://youtu.be/YSFgXc4yG9k?t=83m49s)\n\n[Example 2 The Deep Breath](https://twitter.com/mdz0116/status/1217339380605415424?s=21)\n\nThe fact is, [that’s her reaction of JISOO announcing what was the mission, which was a race to find the phone in the boxes, which means it’s impossible to read comments from phones at that time.](https://youtu.be/YSFgXc4yG9k?t=80m30s)\n\n2. They said the MC ignored JENNIE.\n\n[I watched all 3 sessions of the livestream.](https://youtu.be/YSFgXc4yG9k) And I didn’t find any member was ignored.\n\n[The MC later said,](https://twitter.com/negroblanco28/status/1217292159247716354?s=21) it’s JENNIE (and the staffs) asked not to ask too many questions to her in advance, because she was not feeling well. And all the live-streams were following the script.\n\n3. They said the fans on the scene were OT3.\n\nThe fact is, [just listened to the screams.](https://youtu.be/YSFgXc4yG9k?t=205m55s)\n\n4. They said the thing that a fan—who once said she wouldn’t go to BLACKPINK’s concert, because JENNIE was being lazy on stage—won the dance cover competition at the fan meeting, was disrespectful to JENNIE.\n\nWell, I don’t want to discuss the lack of energy part here. But is that even reasonable that Samsung Indonesia have to investigate what the contestants had said before?\n\n5. They blamed Samsung Indonesia for refusing to let fans do some birthday event for JENNIE, and lying about they’ve prepared that on their own.\n\n[It turns out,](https://twitter.com/yase_lin/status/1217260914132406272?s=21) Samsung Indonesia did prepare something for JENNIE, but YGE side rejected it. This could be just YGE being YGE, or JENNIE was really that unwell to celebrate anything on that evening.\n\nIn conclusion, anyone watched the livestream ([it’s still available to watch)](https://youtu.be/YSFgXc4yG9k) would agree JENNIE did look unwell from the beginning to the end of the event. But how could that lead to JENNIE was treated unfairly, and **DESERVED BETTER**? Also, Did those fans who were angry for JENNIE watch the livestream or replay? If they did, they wouldn’t retweet those gifs blindly. If they didn’t manage to spare some time for a fan meeting livestream or replay, just how much they love JENNIE or BLACKPINK?"}

Blackpink’s US sales could be so much better if people could actually buy from their local store as it would have a bigger impact on the Billboard charts instead of having to buy online and pay for shipping and all this extra stuff. More people would buy as it would be so much easier. Just look at the US sales of any group before and after they distributed in offline stores.\n\nKTL sold roughly less than 10k in the US... that number doesn’t even come close to the amount of fans they have and tickets they sold at the sold out US tour. They clearly have so many American fans but the lack of physical distribution in offline stores is holding them back a lot. \n\nI’m really in the dark as to what UMG has even been doing for Blackpink but to be fair they’re probably being restricted by YGE because it seems like something YGE would do lol."}

Plus C-blinks and international blinks are raising money to mass buy Blackpinks album in order to increase sales. Thus its a good source of income for YG, though YGs biggest revenue comes from touring. \n\nYG is known for being digital monsters. So because they’re more likely to be digitally strong and do well. It makes sense for YG to focus on physical sales especially with huge fan base. Like being able to distribute at international stores like Target and blackpink are very strong in SEA so it makes sense to target their for physical sales in SEA . Or putting more time and emphasis on the physical album.???\n\nIdk ??"}

The reasoning being that the concert will be broadcasted in theatres across Japan as well as YG’s refusal to cancel the concert despite coronavirus concerns.\n\nIf we are getting a CB announcement at the concert, then it kinda makes sense why it will still be going on. YG (a week ago) did say that information about the comeback will be coming soon, and if he cancelled this concert then schedules and plans (should the CB be announced here) would be put into disarray. \n\nDo you guys think this is likely? Or typical clown shit?"}

None of that akgae stuff or comments about someone getting better styling. This is just about personal preference of aesthetic and photo shoot concepts. \n\nFor me it’s Rose. Even though she’s only had one solo photo shoot, the DAZED one was just so much of what I love. The clothes were so gorgeous, the concept was great and her poses were so interesting. I think she has a loot of potential and I hope she works with YSL a lot more. \n\nA close second is jennie. She’s done a lot of photo shoots so her concepts and fashion style is super diverse. I enjoy lisa and jisoo’s solo photo shoots but a lot of them aren’t my personal style.\n\nThe group vogue ones were so gorgeous. I’ve honestly never seen a kpop girl group have such stunning pictorials like that. I can’t wait for comeback teasers and I just hope they’re as amazing!!"}

In the last episode of BP diaries they heavily implied that there will be another season (AKA another world tour) and many sources have also said that BP will have another world tour. I don’t understand why they’d be so secretive and refuse to speak about a world tour that 99% of the fandom knows will happen. \n\nSo what does that leave? Bear in mind that there was a heavy emphasis on the word ‘global.’ \n\nWorldwide fanmeets?\n\nMaybe collab with an international artist? \n\n\n**Or maybe it could be something that reaches international fans:** \n\nSomething like a Netflix series about the girls, a much more deeper and detailed version of BLACKPINK house?\n\nMaybe a movie or documentary?\n\n\nAnother interesting thing to note is that the articles never mentioned an EP or mini album. Whenever DDU or KTL were discussed before they were released, YG always established that they were mini albums. All these articles about BP’s next comeback and there has been no mention of a mini album anywhere."}

But I do hope we get clothing line and Lisa does have creative freedom with it but I think it’s just trading marking her name and YG won’t use it against her because there was a rumor which stated GD and Taeyang were/ are being forced to sign with Yg because they trademarked their stage names.

They started the countdown for Kill this Love exactly 37 days before release. They started the countdown yesterday which means that should this pattern follow, the next comeback will be on March the 13th.\n\n- Jennie and Jisoo have both mentioned that this next comeback will be different to anything they’ve released before. I think YG are smart enough to not give us another hard hitting black concept for the third time in a row, but a softer pink concept: perfect timing for White Day.\n\n- Releasing a song that lines up with a holiday (and a romantic one at that) is extremely smart as people will associate that event with said song: lots of promotion, becomes a national hit, etc etc.\n\n- The practice room photos: they’ve been working on *something.*\n\n- It would mean a Friday release, which big groups usually target for maximum reach and would still line up with the “early 2020” promise that YG made while still avoiding overlap with other YG artists such as iKON and Sechskies."}

Seems like half the fandom want a pink concept and the other half want another hard hitting black concept. \n\nWe have very little to go on regarding what the comeback will be like. The closest thing we have to information about it is from Jennie and Jisoo:\n\n“It’s different to anything we’ve released so far.”\n“Since Blinks are always so supportive of our music, we don’t have any fear when it comes to exploring new concepts.” (paraphrasing here but that was the general gist of what they said)\n\nClown mask on, but do you think this suggests that they’ve already finished the title track? What concept are you hoping for?\n\n\n\n**ALBUM SALES**\n\nKill this Love showed a very impressive growth in album sales for the girls. \n\nSquare Up ended 2018 with 220k album sales when it came out. Kill this Love ended 2019 with 330k album sales. That’s a massive 110k growth in just one comeback. With this rate of growth, it would be logical to conclude that the next comeback will hit the 400k mark before the year ends. \n\nI believe this figure could be higher, should we be given a full album. I’m also interested in the preorder stats and first day sales. For those that don’t know, Kill this Love wasn’t available for preorder. Just recently LOONA clocked an estimated 100k preorders for their comeback, which makes me very interested in what BP will get. As for first day sales, BP has the most for a girl group with 78k. A large factor to this figure was the Chinese fanbase. Given the fact the number of C-Blinks have practically doubled in size since KTL, I think we could comfortably hit 100k first day sales.\n\n\n**CHARTING AND DOMESTIC RECEPTION**\n\nI’m not too worried about charting. A lot of fans have this perception that KTL flopped on the charts, when in reality it went first everywhere except Melon  (where it was second) where it was blocked by a digital monster in BOL4. KTL, despite its “lukewarm” reception to Koreans was still the second most downloaded GG song on Gaon (to Dalla Dalla) and also had the second highest average daily ranking for GG songs (also second to Dalla Dalla). But antis will leave that part out when they try to drag...\n\nSorry for the text dump, but we don’t really see much discussion around here and I thought it would be interesting."}

The truth of the matter is that 2019 has been their biggest year and they are doing better than ever. \n\nLet's see how 2019 went for them - \n\n1. Kill this Love sold VERY well. Had the biggest female debut ever, outsold Square Up and doubled their sales in Japan and China. \n\n2. Had the biggest female kpop tour of ALL TIME. \n\n3. *Doubled* their total streams on Spotify, most streamed and followed girl group worldwide (more than double that of Twice) and had 4 out of 5 most streamed Kpop songs in 2019.\n\n4. *Doubled* their YouTube subscribers from 2018 and have probably the biggest YouTube presence of any artist worldwide, let alone Kpop. \n\n5. By far the biggest Social Media presence in all of Kpop, complete dominance. All 4 girls became the top 4 most followed Kpop artists on Instagram in almost just an year."}

And I’ll explain why I feel this way.\n\n1. They retweeted lots of gifs of JENNIE in the Samsung Indonesia fan meeting, claimed that there were so many toxic comments toward her, so she was sad and almost broke down.\n\n[Example 1](https://twitter.com/106ny/status/1217336160281739264?s=21)\n\nThe fact is, [they’re taking selfie at that time, not reading comments.](https://youtu.be/YSFgXc4yG9k?t=83m49s)\n\n[Example 2 The Deep Breath](https://twitter.com/mdz0116/status/1217339380605415424?s=21)\n\nThe fact is, [that’s her reaction of JISOO announcing what was the mission, which was a race to find the phone in the boxes, which means it’s impossible to read comments from phones at that time.](https://youtu.be/YSFgXc4yG9k?t=80m30s)\n\n2. They said the MC ignored JENNIE.\n\n[I watched all 3 sessions of the livestream.](https://youtu.be/YSFgXc4yG9k) And I didn’t find any member was ignored.\n\n[The MC later said,](https://twitter.com/negroblanco28/status/1217292159247716354?s=21) it’s JENNIE (and the staffs) asked not to ask too many questions to her in advance, because she was not feeling well. And all the live-streams were following the script.\n\n3. They said the fans on the scene were OT3.\n\nThe fact is, [just listened to the screams.](https://youtu.be/YSFgXc4yG9k?t=205m55s)\n\n4. They said the thing that a fan—who once said she wouldn’t go to BLACKPINK’s concert, because JENNIE was being lazy on stage—won the dance cover competition at the fan meeting, was disrespectful to JENNIE.\n\nWell, I don’t want to discuss the lack of energy part here. But is that even reasonable that Samsung Indonesia have to investigate what the contestants had said before?\n\n5. They blamed Samsung Indonesia for refusing to let fans do some birthday event for JENNIE, and lying about they’ve prepared that on their own.\n\n[It turns out,](https://twitter.com/yase_lin/status/1217260914132406272?s=21) Samsung Indonesia did prepare something for JENNIE, but YGE side rejected it. This could be just YGE being YGE, or JENNIE was really that unwell to celebrate anything on that evening.\n\nIn conclusion, anyone watched the livestream ([it’s still available to watch)](https://youtu.be/YSFgXc4yG9k) would agree JENNIE did look unwell from the beginning to the end of the event. But how could that lead to JENNIE was treated unfairly, and **DESERVED BETTER**? Also, Did those fans who were angry for JENNIE watch the livestream or replay? If they did, they wouldn’t retweet those gifs blindly. If they didn’t manage to spare some time for a fan meeting livestream or replay, just how much they love JENNIE or BLACKPINK?"}

Blackpink’s US sales could be so much better if people could actually buy from their local store as it would have a bigger impact on the Billboard charts instead of having to buy online and pay for shipping and all this extra stuff. More people would buy as it would be so much easier. Just look at the US sales of any group before and after they distributed in offline stores.\n\nKTL sold roughly less than 10k in the US... that number doesn’t even come close to the amount of fans they have and tickets they sold at the sold out US tour. They clearly have so many American fans but the lack of physical distribution in offline stores is holding them back a lot. \n\nI’m really in the dark as to what UMG has even been doing for Blackpink but to be fair they’re probably being restricted by YGE because it seems like something YGE would do lol."}

Plus C-blinks and international blinks are raising money to mass buy Blackpinks album in order to increase sales. Thus its a good source of income for YG, though YGs biggest revenue comes from touring. \n\nYG is known for being digital monsters. So because they’re more likely to be digitally strong and do well. It makes sense for YG to focus on physical sales especially with huge fan base. Like being able to distribute at international stores like Target and blackpink are very strong in SEA so it makes sense to target their for physical sales in SEA . Or putting more time and emphasis on the physical album.???\n\nIdk ??"}

The reasoning being that the concert will be broadcasted in theatres across Japan as well as YG’s refusal to cancel the concert despite coronavirus concerns.\n\nIf we are getting a CB announcement at the concert, then it kinda makes sense why it will still be going on. YG (a week ago) did say that information about the comeback will be coming soon, and if he cancelled this concert then schedules and plans (should the CB be announced here) would be put into disarray. \n\nDo you guys think this is likely? Or typical clown shit?"}

None of that akgae stuff or comments about someone getting better styling. This is just about personal preference of aesthetic and photo shoot concepts. \n\nFor me it’s Rose. Even though she’s only had one solo photo shoot, the DAZED one was just so much of what I love. The clothes were so gorgeous, the concept was great and her poses were so interesting. I think she has a loot of potential and I hope she works with YSL a lot more. \n\nA close second is jennie. She’s done a lot of photo shoots so her concepts and fashion style is super diverse. I enjoy lisa and jisoo’s solo photo shoots but a lot of them aren’t my personal style.\n\nThe group vogue ones were so gorgeous. I’ve honestly never seen a kpop girl group have such stunning pictorials like that. I can’t wait for comeback teasers and I just hope they’re as amazing!!"}

In the last episode of BP diaries they heavily implied that there will be another season (AKA another world tour) and many sources have also said that BP will have another world tour. I don’t understand why they’d be so secretive and refuse to speak about a world tour that 99% of the fandom knows will happen. \n\nSo what does that leave? Bear in mind that there was a heavy emphasis on the word ‘global.’ \n\nWorldwide fanmeets?\n\nMaybe collab with an international artist? \n\n\n**Or maybe it could be something that reaches international fans:** \n\nSomething like a Netflix series about the girls, a much more deeper and detailed version of BLACKPINK house?\n\nMaybe a movie or documentary?\n\n\nAnother interesting thing to note is that the articles never mentioned an EP or mini album. Whenever DDU or KTL were discussed before they were released, YG always established that they were mini albums. All these articles about BP’s next comeback and there has been no mention of a mini album anywhere."}

But I do hope we get clothing line and Lisa does have creative freedom with it but I think it’s just trading marking her name and YG won’t use it against her because there was a rumor which stated GD and Taeyang were/ are being forced to sign with Yg because they trademarked their stage names.

They started the countdown for Kill this Love exactly 37 days before release. They started the countdown yesterday which means that should this pattern follow, the next comeback will be on March the 13th.\n\n- Jennie and Jisoo have both mentioned that this next comeback will be different to anything they’ve released before. I think YG are smart enough to not give us another hard hitting black concept for the third time in a row, but a softer pink concept: perfect timing for White Day.\n\n- Releasing a song that lines up with a holiday (and a romantic one at that) is extremely smart as people will associate that event with said song: lots of promotion, becomes a national hit, etc etc.\n\n- The practice room photos: they’ve been working on *something.*\n\n- It would mean a Friday release, which big groups usually target for maximum reach and would still line up with the “early 2020” promise that YG made while still avoiding overlap with other YG artists such as iKON and Sechskies."}

I just see the girls enjoying and feeling the song. BP songs also has substantial amount of english part compared to other K-Pop groups. Their music and dance is spectacular.  \nI closely follow BlackPink and love their personalities a lot. In my own broken version of Korean language, I can sing the song from beginning to end (imitating the sounds).  \n\n\nAm I the only one who does this?

Seems like half the fandom want a pink concept and the other half want another hard hitting black concept. \n\nWe have very little to go on regarding what the comeback will be like. The closest thing we have to information about it is from Jennie and Jisoo:\n\n“It’s different to anything we’ve released so far.”\n“Since Blinks are always so supportive of our music, we don’t have any fear when it comes to exploring new concepts.” (paraphrasing here but that was the general gist of what they said)\n\nClown mask on, but do you think this suggests that they’ve already finished the title track? What concept are you hoping for?\n\n\n\n**ALBUM SALES**\n\nKill this Love showed a very impressive growth in album sales for the girls. \n\nSquare Up ended 2018 with 220k album sales when it came out. Kill this Love ended 2019 with 330k album sales. That’s a massive 110k growth in just one comeback. With this rate of growth, it would be logical to conclude that the next comeback will hit the 400k mark before the year ends. \n\nI believe this figure could be higher, should we be given a full album. I’m also interested in the preorder stats and first day sales. For those that don’t know, Kill this Love wasn’t available for preorder. Just recently LOONA clocked an estimated 100k preorders for their comeback, which makes me very interested in what BP will get. As for first day sales, BP has the most for a girl group with 78k. A large factor to this figure was the Chinese fanbase. Given the fact the number of C-Blinks have practically doubled in size since KTL, I think we could comfortably hit 100k first day sales.\n\n\n**CHARTING AND DOMESTIC RECEPTION**\n\nI’m not too worried about charting. A lot of fans have this perception that KTL flopped on the charts, when in reality it went first everywhere except Melon  (where it was second) where it was blocked by a digital monster in BOL4. KTL, despite its “lukewarm” reception to Koreans was still the second most downloaded GG song on Gaon (to Dalla Dalla) and also had the second highest average daily ranking for GG songs (also second to Dalla Dalla). But antis will leave that part out when they try to drag...\n\nSorry for the text dump, but we don’t really see much discussion around here and I thought it would be interesting."}

The truth of the matter is that 2019 has been their biggest year and they are doing better than ever. \n\nLet's see how 2019 went for them - \n\n1. Kill this Love sold VERY well. Had the biggest female debut ever, outsold Square Up and doubled their sales in Japan and China. \n\n2. Had the biggest female kpop tour of ALL TIME. \n\n3. *Doubled* their total streams on Spotify, most streamed and followed girl group worldwide (more than double that of Twice) and had 4 out of 5 most streamed Kpop songs in 2019.\n\n4. *Doubled* their YouTube subscribers from 2018 and have probably the biggest YouTube presence of any artist worldwide, let alone Kpop. \n\n5. By far the biggest Social Media presence in all of Kpop, complete dominance. All 4 girls became the top 4 most followed Kpop artists on Instagram in almost just an year."}

And I’ll explain why I feel this way.\n\n1. They retweeted lots of gifs of JENNIE in the Samsung Indonesia fan meeting, claimed that there were so many toxic comments toward her, so she was sad and almost broke down.\n\n[Example 1](https://twitter.com/106ny/status/1217336160281739264?s=21)\n\nThe fact is, [they’re taking selfie at that time, not reading comments.](https://youtu.be/YSFgXc4yG9k?t=83m49s)\n\n[Example 2 The Deep Breath](https://twitter.com/mdz0116/status/1217339380605415424?s=21)\n\nThe fact is, [that’s her reaction of JISOO announcing what was the mission, which was a race to find the phone in the boxes, which means it’s impossible to read comments from phones at that time.](https://youtu.be/YSFgXc4yG9k?t=80m30s)\n\n2. They said the MC ignored JENNIE.\n\n[I watched all 3 sessions of the livestream.](https://youtu.be/YSFgXc4yG9k) And I didn’t find any member was ignored.\n\n[The MC later said,](https://twitter.com/negroblanco28/status/1217292159247716354?s=21) it’s JENNIE (and the staffs) asked not to ask too many questions to her in advance, because she was not feeling well. And all the live-streams were following the script.\n\n3. They said the fans on the scene were OT3.\n\nThe fact is, [just listened to the screams.](https://youtu.be/YSFgXc4yG9k?t=205m55s)\n\n4. They said the thing that a fan—who once said she wouldn’t go to BLACKPINK’s concert, because JENNIE was being lazy on stage—won the dance cover competition at the fan meeting, was disrespectful to JENNIE.\n\nWell, I don’t want to discuss the lack of energy part here. But is that even reasonable that Samsung Indonesia have to investigate what the contestants had said before?\n\n5. They blamed Samsung Indonesia for refusing to let fans do some birthday event for JENNIE, and lying about they’ve prepared that on their own.\n\n[It turns out,](https://twitter.com/yase_lin/status/1217260914132406272?s=21) Samsung Indonesia did prepare something for JENNIE, but YGE side rejected it. This could be just YGE being YGE, or JENNIE was really that unwell to celebrate anything on that evening.\n\nIn conclusion, anyone watched the livestream ([it’s still available to watch)](https://youtu.be/YSFgXc4yG9k) would agree JENNIE did look unwell from the beginning to the end of the event. But how could that lead to JENNIE was treated unfairly, and **DESERVED BETTER**? Also, Did those fans who were angry for JENNIE watch the livestream or replay? If they did, they wouldn’t retweet those gifs blindly. If they didn’t manage to spare some time for a fan meeting livestream or replay, just how much they love JENNIE or BLACKPINK?"}

Blackpink’s US sales could be so much better if people could actually buy from their local store as it would have a bigger impact on the Billboard charts instead of having to buy online and pay for shipping and all this extra stuff. More people would buy as it would be so much easier. Just look at the US sales of any group before and after they distributed in offline stores.\n\nKTL sold roughly less than 10k in the US... that number doesn’t even come close to the amount of fans they have and tickets they sold at the sold out US tour. They clearly have so many American fans but the lack of physical distribution in offline stores is holding them back a lot. \n\nI’m really in the dark as to what UMG has even been doing for Blackpink but to be fair they’re probably being restricted by YGE because it seems like something YGE would do lol."}

Plus C-blinks and international blinks are raising money to mass buy Blackpinks album in order to increase sales. Thus its a good source of income for YG, though YGs biggest revenue comes from touring. \n\nYG is known for being digital monsters. So because they’re more likely to be digitally strong and do well. It makes sense for YG to focus on physical sales especially with huge fan base. Like being able to distribute at international stores like Target and blackpink are very strong in SEA so it makes sense to target their for physical sales in SEA . Or putting more time and emphasis on the physical album.???\n\nIdk ??"}

The reasoning being that the concert will be broadcasted in theatres across Japan as well as YG’s refusal to cancel the concert despite coronavirus concerns.\n\nIf we are getting a CB announcement at the concert, then it kinda makes sense why it will still be going on. YG (a week ago) did say that information about the comeback will be coming soon, and if he cancelled this concert then schedules and plans (should the CB be announced here) would be put into disarray. \n\nDo you guys think this is likely? Or typical clown shit?"}

None of that akgae stuff or comments about someone getting better styling. This is just about personal preference of aesthetic and photo shoot concepts. \n\nFor me it’s Rose. Even though she’s only had one solo photo shoot, the DAZED one was just so much of what I love. The clothes were so gorgeous, the concept was great and her poses were so interesting. I think she has a loot of potential and I hope she works with YSL a lot more. \n\nA close second is jennie. She’s done a lot of photo shoots so her concepts and fashion style is super diverse. I enjoy lisa and jisoo’s solo photo shoots but a lot of them aren’t my personal style.\n\nThe group vogue ones were so gorgeous. I’ve honestly never seen a kpop girl group have such stunning pictorials like that. I can’t wait for comeback teasers and I just hope they’re as amazing!!"}

In the last episode of BP diaries they heavily implied that there will be another season (AKA another world tour) and many sources have also said that BP will have another world tour. I don’t understand why they’d be so secretive and refuse to speak about a world tour that 99% of the fandom knows will happen. \n\nSo what does that leave? Bear in mind that there was a heavy emphasis on the word ‘global.’ \n\nWorldwide fanmeets?\n\nMaybe collab with an international artist? \n\n\n**Or maybe it could be something that reaches international fans:** \n\nSomething like a Netflix series about the girls, a much more deeper and detailed version of BLACKPINK house?\n\nMaybe a movie or documentary?\n\n\nAnother interesting thing to note is that the articles never mentioned an EP or mini album. Whenever DDU or KTL were discussed before they were released, YG always established that they were mini albums. All these articles about BP’s next comeback and there has been no mention of a mini album anywhere."}

But I do hope we get clothing line and Lisa does have creative freedom with it but I think it’s just trading marking her name and YG won’t use it against her because there was a rumor which stated GD and Taeyang were/ are being forced to sign with Yg because they trademarked their stage names.

They started the countdown for Kill this Love exactly 37 days before release. They started the countdown yesterday which means that should this pattern follow, the next comeback will be on March the 13th.\n\n- Jennie and Jisoo have both mentioned that this next comeback will be different to anything they’ve released before. I think YG are smart enough to not give us another hard hitting black concept for the third time in a row, but a softer pink concept: perfect timing for White Day.\n\n- Releasing a song that lines up with a holiday (and a romantic one at that) is extremely smart as people will associate that event with said song: lots of promotion, becomes a national hit, etc etc.\n\n- The practice room photos: they’ve been working on *something.*\n\n- It would mean a Friday release, which big groups usually target for maximum reach and would still line up with the “early 2020” promise that YG made while still avoiding overlap with other YG artists such as iKON and Sechskies."}

Seems like half the fandom want a pink concept and the other half want another hard hitting black concept. \n\nWe have very little to go on regarding what the comeback will be like. The closest thing we have to information about it is from Jennie and Jisoo:\n\n“It’s different to anything we’ve released so far.”\n“Since Blinks are always so supportive of our music, we don’t have any fear when it comes to exploring new concepts.” (paraphrasing here but that was the general gist of what they said)\n\nClown mask on, but do you think this suggests that they’ve already finished the title track? What concept are you hoping for?\n\n\n\n**ALBUM SALES**\n\nKill this Love showed a very impressive growth in album sales for the girls. \n\nSquare Up ended 2018 with 220k album sales when it came out. Kill this Love ended 2019 with 330k album sales. That’s a massive 110k growth in just one comeback. With this rate of growth, it would be logical to conclude that the next comeback will hit the 400k mark before the year ends. \n\nI believe this figure could be higher, should we be given a full album. I’m also interested in the preorder stats and first day sales. For those that don’t know, Kill this Love wasn’t available for preorder. Just recently LOONA clocked an estimated 100k preorders for their comeback, which makes me very interested in what BP will get. As for first day sales, BP has the most for a girl group with 78k. A large factor to this figure was the Chinese fanbase. Given the fact the number of C-Blinks have practically doubled in size since KTL, I think we could comfortably hit 100k first day sales.\n\n\n**CHARTING AND DOMESTIC RECEPTION**\n\nI’m not too worried about charting. A lot of fans have this perception that KTL flopped on the charts, when in reality it went first everywhere except Melon  (where it was second) where it was blocked by a digital monster in BOL4. KTL, despite its “lukewarm” reception to Koreans was still the second most downloaded GG song on Gaon (to Dalla Dalla) and also had the second highest average daily ranking for GG songs (also second to Dalla Dalla). But antis will leave that part out when they try to drag...\n\nSorry for the text dump, but we don’t really see much discussion around here and I thought it would be interesting."}

The truth of the matter is that 2019 has been their biggest year and they are doing better than ever. \n\nLet's see how 2019 went for them - \n\n1. Kill this Love sold VERY well. Had the biggest female debut ever, outsold Square Up and doubled their sales in Japan and China. \n\n2. Had the biggest female kpop tour of ALL TIME. \n\n3. *Doubled* their total streams on Spotify, most streamed and followed girl group worldwide (more than double that of Twice) and had 4 out of 5 most streamed Kpop songs in 2019.\n\n4. *Doubled* their YouTube subscribers from 2018 and have probably the biggest YouTube presence of any artist worldwide, let alone Kpop. \n\n5. By far the biggest Social Media presence in all of Kpop, complete dominance. All 4 girls became the top 4 most followed Kpop artists on Instagram in almost just an year."}

And I’ll explain why I feel this way.\n\n1. They retweeted lots of gifs of JENNIE in the Samsung Indonesia fan meeting, claimed that there were so many toxic comments toward her, so she was sad and almost broke down.\n\n[Example 1](https://twitter.com/106ny/status/1217336160281739264?s=21)\n\nThe fact is, [they’re taking selfie at that time, not reading comments.](https://youtu.be/YSFgXc4yG9k?t=83m49s)\n\n[Example 2 The Deep Breath](https://twitter.com/mdz0116/status/1217339380605415424?s=21)\n\nThe fact is, [that’s her reaction of JISOO announcing what was the mission, which was a race to find the phone in the boxes, which means it’s impossible to read comments from phones at that time.](https://youtu.be/YSFgXc4yG9k?t=80m30s)\n\n2. They said the MC ignored JENNIE.\n\n[I watched all 3 sessions of the livestream.](https://youtu.be/YSFgXc4yG9k) And I didn’t find any member was ignored.\n\n[The MC later said,](https://twitter.com/negroblanco28/status/1217292159247716354?s=21) it’s JENNIE (and the staffs) asked not to ask too many questions to her in advance, because she was not feeling well. And all the live-streams were following the script.\n\n3. They said the fans on the scene were OT3.\n\nThe fact is, [just listened to the screams.](https://youtu.be/YSFgXc4yG9k?t=205m55s)\n\n4. They said the thing that a fan—who once said she wouldn’t go to BLACKPINK’s concert, because JENNIE was being lazy on stage—won the dance cover competition at the fan meeting, was disrespectful to JENNIE.\n\nWell, I don’t want to discuss the lack of energy part here. But is that even reasonable that Samsung Indonesia have to investigate what the contestants had said before?\n\n5. They blamed Samsung Indonesia for refusing to let fans do some birthday event for JENNIE, and lying about they’ve prepared that on their own.\n\n[It turns out,](https://twitter.com/yase_lin/status/1217260914132406272?s=21) Samsung Indonesia did prepare something for JENNIE, but YGE side rejected it. This could be just YGE being YGE, or JENNIE was really that unwell to celebrate anything on that evening.\n\nIn conclusion, anyone watched the livestream ([it’s still available to watch)](https://youtu.be/YSFgXc4yG9k) would agree JENNIE did look unwell from the beginning to the end of the event. But how could that lead to JENNIE was treated unfairly, and **DESERVED BETTER**? Also, Did those fans who were angry for JENNIE watch the livestream or replay? If they did, they wouldn’t retweet those gifs blindly. If they didn’t manage to spare some time for a fan meeting livestream or replay, just how much they love JENNIE or BLACKPINK?"}
